Purpose of this sample project is to make students familiar with basic technologies they're going to use during the Software Engineering Lab at Technical University of Dresden.

## Quickstart

NOTE: The Quickstart requires Java 8, Maven 3 and a recent Git (2.0.x preferred) to be available on your machine. If you miss any of those go through the steps described in <<prerequisites>>

[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/videoshop
$ cd videoshop
$ mvn clean package
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

After that point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

Note the standard admin user is named `boss` and has the password `123`.

## IDE Setup

### Eclipse

Grab the latest https://spring.io/tools/sts/all[STS] (Spring Tool Suite or plain Eclipse Luna should work as well), run installer or unzip and run it.

Select menu:File[Import], select menu:Maven[Existing Maven Projects], select the folder you checked the project out into and hit btn:[Finish]. This will import the project into your workspace.

In the Console view you might wanna click the btn:[Open Console] button and select Maven Console to see that Maven is downloading dependencies, sources and Javadocs.

### IntelliJ

Grab the latest https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA IDE] (both Community Edition and Ultimate Edition will work), install it according to the instructions on their website and run it.

From the Welcome Screen, select btn:[Import Project]. Otherwise, if you've already opened another project, you'll need to select menu:File[New > Project from existing sources].
Now, navigate to the folder you checked the project out into, select the `pom.xml` file and hit btn:[Open].

In the opened wizard, additionally select the checkboxes btn:[Import Maven projects automatically], as well as the btn:[Sources] and btn:[Documentation] checkboxes next to btn:[Automically download] and hit btn:[Next].
On the next page, do not select any profile and hit btn:[Next]. Now, ensure the Maven project is selected for import and hit btn:[Next].
On the following page, ensure you've selected a 1.8 or higher JDK and hit btn:[Next].
On the final page, leave the suggested project name as is and hit btn:[Finish].

Now you have to wait a bit while IntelliJ and Maven work on importing the project, which includes downloading all required dependencies from the internet.
All IDE activities are displayed in the status bar.

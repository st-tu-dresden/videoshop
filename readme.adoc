Purpose of this sample project is to make students familiar with basic technologies they're going to use during the Software Engineering Lab at Technical University of Dresden.

## Quickstart

NOTE: The Quickstart requires Java 8, Maven 3 and a recent Git (2.0.x preferred) to be available on your machine. If you miss any of those go through the steps described in <<prerequisites>>

[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/guestbook
$ cd guestbook
$ mvn clean package
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

After that point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Prerequisites

### Java 8

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Download] the binaries, install. Make sure the console shows something like this:

[source, bash]
----
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_20-ea"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-ea-b22)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b21, mixed mode)
----

### Maven 3.x

http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Download] the binaries, unzip to an arbitrary location and make sure the `bin` folder of the unzipped result is in your path:

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.1.1 (0728685237757ffbf44136acec0402957f723d9a; 2013-09-17 17:22:22+0200)
Maven home: /Applications/Tools/maven-3
Java version: 1.8.0_20-ea, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: de_DE, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.9.4", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
----

### Git

http://git-scm.com/download[Download] the binaries, run the installer. Verify the command line shows something like this after install:

[source, bash]
----
$ git --version
git version 1.8.5.2 (Apple Git-48)
----

## IDE Setup

Grab the latest https://spring.io/tools/sts/all[STS] (Spring Tool Suite, plain Eclipse Luna or IntelliJ should work as well), run installer or unzip and run it.

Select menu:File[Import], select menu:Maven[Existing Maven Projects], select the folder you checked the project out into and hit btn:[Finish]. This will import the project into your workspace.

In the Console view you might wanna click the btn:[Open Console] button and select Maven Console to see that Maven is downloading dependencies, sources and Javadocs.

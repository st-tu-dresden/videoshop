Purpose of this sample project is to make students familiar with basic technologies they're going to use during the Software Engineering Lab at Technical University of Dresden.

## Quickstart

NOTE: The Quickstart requires Java 11 and a recent Git (2.20 or newer preferred) to be available on your machine. If you miss any of those go through the steps described in <<prerequisites>>.
Also, note that you have to run `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw` if you run Windows by accident.

[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/videoshop
$ cd videoshop
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

After that point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

Note that the standard admin user is named `boss` and has the password `123`.

## Prerequisites

### Java 11

https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot[Download] the binaries, install. Make sure the console shows something like this:

[source, bash]
----
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.12+7 (build 11.0.12+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.12+7 (build 11.0.12+7, mixed mode)
----

Make sure that the wrapped Maven picks up the same JDK version and that the following command shows similar output:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./mvnw --version
Apache Maven 3.8.3 (ff8e977a158738155dc465c6a97ffaf31982d739)
Maven home: /Users/JavaJoe/.m2/wrapper/dists/apache-maven-3.8.3-bin/5a6n1u8or3307vo2u2jgmkhm0t/apache-maven-3.8.3
Java version: 11.0.12, vendor: Eclipse Adoptium, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-11.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: de_DE, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "11.6", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
----

### Git

https://git-scm.com/download[Download] the binaries, run the installer. Verify the command line shows something like this after install:

[source, bash]
----
$ git --version
git version 2.33.0
----

## IDE Setup

### Eclipse

Grab the latest https://spring.io/tools[Spring Tool Suite] (plain Eclipse should work as well), run installer or unzip and run it.

Select menu:File[Import], select menu:Maven[Existing Maven Projects], select the folder you checked the project out into and hit btn:[Finish]. This will import the project into your workspace.

In the Console view you might wanna click the btn:[Open Console] button and select Maven Console to see that Maven is downloading dependencies, sources and Javadocs.

### IntelliJ

Grab the latest https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA IDE] (both Community Edition and Ultimate Edition will work), install it according to the instructions on their website and run it.

From the Welcome Screen, select btn:[Open]. Otherwise, if you've already opened another project, you'll need to select menu:File[Openâ€¦].
Now, navigate to the folder you checked the project out into (it should contain `pom.xml`), select it and hit btn:[Open].
When asked whether to trust and open the Maven project, proceed with btn:[Trust Project].

Now you have to wait a bit while IntelliJ and Maven work on importing the project, which includes downloading all required dependencies from the internet.
All IDE activities are displayed in the status bar.
